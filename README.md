# Warhammer_BBDD

This is a personal project for a Warhammer Inventory Focused Database.
The program includes a graphical user interface made with Tkinter, a database that is not very complex thanks to SQLite and basic object-oriented Python.
Being the first version you can find bugs and improvements.
Feel free to collaborate or use it.
